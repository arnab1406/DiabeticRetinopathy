• Experimented with the usage of depth wise separable convolution and compound scaling for building deep convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and image classification using PyTorch.

• Pre-processed the data using CLAHE and Gamma Correction techniques with OpenCV and scikit-image.

• Implemented non-referential image quality analysis techniques using numpy for EDA and data cleaning.
